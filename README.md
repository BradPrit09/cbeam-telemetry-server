c-beam telemetry server
=======================

This is a telemetry server for connecting the NASA [OpenMCT](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/) with information sources on [c-base's](https://c-base.org/) c-beam telemetry network. It is based on the OpenMCT [telemetry adapter tutorial](http://nasa.github.io/openmct/docs/tutorials/#telemetry-adapter).
